You are welcome to choose and download this open source version of Chinese-style school and home: Unofficial version mod,

This update may be slower than the release version, but you can add, change, delete mod content and files yourself.

Just indicate that it is not made by you.

This module is open source under the MIT protocol, but the finished module file is not available, and the MIT license may not be used

If you see my open source project on a platform like Gitcode instead of GitHub, don't believe it

If you see my module on some websites, especially international ones like the websites in the links below, it may be an old version with poor internationalization support. You can upload the language pack under this open-source version and create your own open-source version. The author may also push updates to the main version.
